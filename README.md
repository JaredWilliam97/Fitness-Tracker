Workout Tracker

- In this app, I'll be creating a workout tracker. In this app I will create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

This will allow consumers to reach goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

- When you load the page, you will be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

You will be able to:

- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
